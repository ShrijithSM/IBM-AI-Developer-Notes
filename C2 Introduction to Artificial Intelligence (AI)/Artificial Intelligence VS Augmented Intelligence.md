1. **Human Intelligence**:
   - Required for basic driving tasks: steering, checking mirrors, and operating the vehicle manually.

2. **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**:
   - Used in the self-driving feature of the car.
   - Tasks: Staying in its own lane, maintaining speed, keeping distance from other vehicles without human input.
   - **Definition**: AI replaces the need for humans in tasks such as reasoning, communication, and problem-solving.
   - **Key Features**: 
     - Ingests large amounts of data quickly.
     - Performs repetitive tasks with high accuracy.
     - Suitable for tasks that require speed, precision, and data analysis.

3. **Augmented Intelligence**:
   - Augmented intelligence was used in driver-assist features like collision detection and blind spot avoidance.
   - **Definition**: A collaboration between humans and machines that enhances human capabilities.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Complements human capabilities.
     - Examples include screen readers, voice-driven navigation, and collision avoidance systems.

4. **Strengths Matrix (Machines vs. Humans)**:
   - **Machines**:
     - Good at processing large amounts of data quickly.
     - Reliable and accurate at repetitive tasks.
     - Do not tire out.
   - **Humans**:
     - Excellent at generalizing information from small data.
     - Creative and capable of solving problems in novel ways.
     - Emotional intelligence: understanding and responding to others' emotions.
     - Critical for tasks involving human interaction, such as customer service and caregiving.

5. **Why Augmented Intelligence?**:
   - Combines human strengths (creativity, generalization, emotional intelligence) with machine strengths (data processing, accuracy).
   - Allows humans to accomplish tasks that would be impossible on their own.
   - **Best Result**: A combination of both artificial and augmented intelligence to achieve optimal outcomes.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Augmented intelligence allows humans to thrive by leveraging machine capabilities while maintaining human creativity and decision-making.
   - It ensures tasks are performed safely and efficiently, as in the example of driving.
