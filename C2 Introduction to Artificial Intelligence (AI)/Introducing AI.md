1. **Definition of AI**:
   - AI stands for Artificial Intelligence, referring to the simulation of human intelligence by computer systems.
   - AI encompasses tasks such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making.

2. **History of AI**:
   - AI's journey started in the 1950s with Alan Turing and John McCarthy.
   - Early programs like ELIZA and SHRDLU (1960s).
   - Expert systems rose in the 1970s.
   - The 1980s saw a surge in machine learning.
   - Neural networks were introduced in the 1990s.
   - Deep learning gained prominence in the 2000s.
   - From 2010-2020, AI applications like NLP and computer vision expanded across industries.

3. **Key Enabling Technologies**:
   - **Internet**: Faster access to information.
   - **Distributed Computing**: Scales data processing.
   - **IoT**: Connected devices generate large amounts of data.
   - **Social Networking**: Encourages unstructured data generation.

4. **Types of AI Based on Strength**:
   - **Weak AI (Narrow AI)**: Specific to a domain; can perform specific tasks but cannot learn new ones.
    - Examples: Language translators, virtual assistants, spam filters.
   - **Strong AI (Generalized AI)**: Capable of performing diverse tasks, acquiring new skills, and learning new approaches.
     - Use cases: Finance, human resources, IT, R&D, supply chain.
   - **Super AI (Conscious AI)**: Human-level consciousness with advanced cognitive abilities (still theoretical).

5. **Learning Methods in AI**:
   - **Supervised Learning**: Machines learn from labeled data.
   - **Unsupervised Learning**: Machines learn patterns from unlabeled data.
   - **Reinforcement Learning**: Machines learn through trial and error by receiving feedback.

6. **Innate Intelligence vs. Machine Learning**:
   - **Innate Intelligence (Human)**: Governs bodily functions and natural growth.
   - **Machine Learning**: Only has the intelligence we provide through algorithms and data.

7. **AI as Augmented Intelligence**:
   - AI is designed to extend human capabilities, enabling experts to make better, faster decisions by handling time-consuming tasks.

8. **Fields that Shape AI**:
   - **Computer Science & Electrical Engineering**: Software and hardware implementation.
   - **Mathematics & Statistics**: Model development and performance measurement.
   - **Psychology & Linguistics**: Modeling AI on human brain functions and language.
   - **Philosophy**: Guidance on intelligence and ethics.

9. **Current AI Impact**:
   - AI is already embedded in various daily decision-making processes and is proving to be impactful across domains like healthcare, autonomous systems, and environmental conservation.
