																	1. **Traditional AI Structure**:
   - **Repository**: The source of organizational data (tables, rows, columns, images, documents).
   - **Analytics Platform**: A system to process data and build predictive models. Examples: SPSS Modeler, Watson Studio.
   - **Application Layer**: Where models are deployed to drive decisions, e.g., customer churn prevention in telecommunications.
   - **Predictive Models**: Not AI in themselves but become AI when paired with a feedback loop.
   - **Feedback Loop**: Critical to learning from the system's successes and failures, improving model accuracy over time. Allows the AI to self-correct by learning from its mistakes (e.g., predicting customer churn).

2. **Generative AI and the New Paradigm**:
   - **Massive Data Sets**: Unlike traditional AI, generative AI starts with a large amount of data from global sources, not just the organization’s repository.
   - **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: 
     - These are incredibly powerful, general models trained on vast quantities of information.
     - They contain data about nearly everything but often lack specifics about an organization’s unique needs.
   - **Prompting and Tuning**:
     - To make LLMs more relevant to a specific business problem, you apply prompting and tuning.
     - This process fine-tunes the model, tailoring it to address particular issues, like customer churn for a specific company.
   - **Application Layer**: Similar to traditional AI, the application layer is where the tuned models are implemented and consumed for practical business use.
   - **Feedback Loop**: It feeds back into the prompting and tuning process rather than back into the data repository since the data is too vast and external.

3. **Key Differences**:
   - **Data Sources**: Traditional AI relies on internal organizational data, while generative AI uses a much larger and more diverse dataset from global sources.
   - **Model Size and Complexity**: Generative AI uses LLMs and models built on huge datasets, which would be impossible for any single organization to store or process.
   - **Fine-tuning**: Generative AI models need to be adapted through prompting and tuning to make them specific to the organization’s needs.
   - **Architecture**: Generative AI requires a fundamentally different architecture due to the scale of data and models used.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Traditional AI is more focused on using internal data and applying predictive models with feedback loops for automation.
   - Generative AI represents a shift to massive datasets and large, generalized models that are customized for specific tasks through tuning and prompting, with feedback loops improving these customizations.
