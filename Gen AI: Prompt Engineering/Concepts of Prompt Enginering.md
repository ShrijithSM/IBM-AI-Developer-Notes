- A prompt is any input or a series of instructions you provide to a generative model to produce a desired output.
    
- These instructions help in directing the creativity of the model and assist it in producing relevant and logical responses. 
    
- The building blocks of a well-structured prompt include instruction, context, input data, and output indicators. 
    
- These elements help the model comprehend our necessities and generate relevant responses. 
    
- Prompt engineering is designing effective prompts to leverage the full capabilities of the generative AI models in producing optimal responses.
    
- Refining a prompt involves experimenting with various factors that could influence the output from the model.
    
- Prompt engineering helps optimize model efficiency, boost performance, understand model constraints, and enhance its security.
    
- Writing effective prompts is essential for supervising the style, tone, and content of output.
    
- Best practices for writing effective prompts can be implemented across four dimensions: clarity, context, precision, and role-play.
    
- Prompt engineering tools provide various features and functionalities to optimize prompts. 
    
- Some of these functionalities include suggestions for prompts, contextual understanding, iterative refinement, bias mitigation, domain-specific aid, and libraries of predefined prompts. 
    
- A few common tools and platforms for prompt engineering include IBM watsonx Prompt Lab, Spellbook, Dust, and PromptPerfect.
